# Martin Kamau

Hi, I’m a **Data Engineer** with a strong background in data transformation, pipeline orchestration, and infrastructure automation. I specialize in designing scalable ETL/ELT solutions, managing both structured and unstructured data, and integrating data across systems to drive analytics and reporting. My experience spans Airflow DAGs, cloud data warehouses, SQL optimization, and delivering real-world data solutions from end to end.
